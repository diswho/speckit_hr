# Research: HR Management Web Application

This document outlines the research needed to resolve the "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items in the implementation plan, with a focus on a FastAPI backend and a TypeScript frontend.

## 1. Technology Stack

### Decision
- **Backend Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Frontend Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Next.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: Pytest (Backend), Jest for unit/integration tests (Frontend), Cypress for end-to-end tests (Frontend).

### Rationale
- **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance Python web framework that's easy to learn and use. It's a great choice for building RESTful APIs and has automatic interactive documentation.
- **TypeScript/React/Next.js**: A powerful and popular combination for building modern, server-rendered React applications. It offers a great developer experience and performance optimizations.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust, open-source relational database that can handle complex queries and data relationships, which is suitable for an HR application.
- **Pytest/Jest/Cypress**: A comprehensive testing suite that covers all aspects of the application, from backend unit tests to frontend end-to-end tests.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, Django.
- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Angular, Svelte.
- **Database**: MySQL, MongoDB.

## 2. ZKTimeNet Integration

### Decision
- The integration will be done via a direct database connection to the ZKTimeNet database to read attendance and time logs. A dedicated service will be created in the backend to handle this integration.

### Rationale
- A direct database connection is the most reliable way to get real-time data from ZKTimeNet, assuming the database is accessible. This avoids the need for file parsing or a potentially non-existent API.

### Alternatives Considered
- **API Integration**: If ZKTimeNet provides a REST or SOAP API, this would be a cleaner approach. However, the availability of an API is not guaranteed.
- **File Import**: This would involve exporting data from ZKTimeNet to a file (e.g., CSV, Excel) and then importing it into the HR application. This is less efficient and more prone to errors.

## 3. Performance and Scale

### Decision
- **Performance Goals**: The application should have a p95 latency of less than 200ms for all API endpoints under a load of 100 concurrent users.
- **Scale/Scope**: The application should be designed to support up to 1,000 active users and store data for up to 10,000 employees.

### Rationale
- These are reasonable starting points for a medium-sized HR application. The architecture should be designed to be scalable to handle future growth.

### Alternatives Considered
- Higher performance and scalability targets would require a more complex and expensive infrastructure. The current targets are a good balance between performance and cost.
