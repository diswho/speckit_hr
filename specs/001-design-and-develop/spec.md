## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an HR Manager, I want a centralized web application to manage the entire employee lifecycle, from recruiting and onboarding to performance reviews, so that I can improve efficiency, reduce manual work, and gain better insights into HR metrics.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** I am logged in as an HR Manager, **When** I navigate to the recruiting module, **Then** I should be able to create a new job opening.
2.  **Given** a new employee is hired, **When** I log in as an HR Manager, **Then** I should be able to assign them an onboarding plan with predefined tasks.
3.  **Given** it is the end of a quarter, **When** I log in as a Department Head, **Then** I should be able to initiate performance reviews for my team members.
4.  **Given** I am a new hire, **When** I log in, **Then** I should see a list of my onboarding tasks on my dashboard.
5.  **Given** I am a job applicant, **When** I apply for a job, **Then** I should receive an email confirmation and be able to track my application status.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a user tries to access a module they don't have permission for?
- How does the system handle the deactivation of an employee's account when they leave the company?
- What is the process for an applicant withdrawing their application?
