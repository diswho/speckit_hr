## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on HOW to build, not WHAT to build
- üìù This is a living document; update it as you learn
- ü§ù Generate artifacts that are useful for developers

### For AI Generation
1. **Follow the Execution Flow**: Complete each step in order.
2. **Update Progress Tracking**: Mark each phase as `Done` or `Blocked`.
3. **Generate Artifacts**: Create the specified files in the same directory as this plan.
4. **Be Detailed**: Provide enough technical detail for a developer to start working.
5. **If Blocked**: Clearly state the reason for the block.

## Feature Spec Summary
The feature is an HR Management Web App for handling recruiting, onboarding, and performance reviews. Key features include a personalized dashboard, job posting management, applicant tracking, onboarding task assignment, performance review scheduling with self-assessments, reporting, and notifications. The system must integrate with ZKTimeNet and have a clean, professional UI with role-based access control.

## Constitutional Checks
The project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is a template with no specific, actionable rules defined. Therefore, no constitutional violations were found.

## Technical Context
*User-provided details from `@specs/001-design-and-build/spec.md`*

The application is a web-based platform for HR managers.

**Key Features:**
- **Dashboard**: Personalized view for HR managers, department heads, employees, and job applicants.
- **Recruiting**: Manage job postings and track applicant pipelines.
- **Onboarding**: Create and assign onboarding tasks for new hires.
- **Performance Reviews**: Schedule reviews and allow employees to complete self-assessments.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on recruiting and performance data.
- **Notifications**: Send automated reminders for key tasks and events.
- **Integration**: Must import data from ZKTimeNet via a direct, read-only database connection. The import will run as a nightly batch process, synchronizing employee master data and attendance data.
- **UI/UX**: Clean, professional, and intuitive user interface.
- **Security**: Secure, role-based access control with four defined roles (HR Manager, Department Head, Employee, Applicant) and specific CRUD permissions for each.

**Identified Ambiguities:**
- None. The specification is clear.
