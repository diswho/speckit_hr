# Research & Discovery: HR Management Web App

**Status**: Completed

This document outlines the proposed technical solutions and architecture for the HR Management Web App, based on the requirements in the feature specification.

## 1. Proposed Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Rationale**: FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for Python that is easy to learn and use. It provides automatic data validation and documentation (via OpenAPI), which will be crucial for building a robust API.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Django (more monolithic, steeper learning curve), Flask (more minimalist, requires more boilerplate).

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React (with TypeScript)
- **Rationale**: React is the most popular frontend library with a vast ecosystem of tools and components. TypeScript will add static typing, improving code quality and maintainability.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Vue.js (also a good choice, but React has a larger community), Angular (more opinionated and complex).

### Database
- **Type**: PostgreSQL
- **Rationale**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It can handle complex queries and has excellent support for custom data types, which will be useful for the HR data.
- **Alternatives Considered**: MySQL/MariaDB (also good choices, but PostgreSQL is often preferred for new projects requiring high data integrity), SQLite (not suitable for a production web application).

## 2. ZKTimeNet Integration

### Approach
- A direct, read-only connection to the ZKTimeNet database will be established from the backend.
- A nightly batch process will be created to synchronize data from ZKTimeNet to the application's PostgreSQL database. This will prevent performance issues that could arise from querying the ZKTimeNet database directly in response to user requests.

### Technology
- **Database Connector**: `psycopg2` or `asyncpg` for connecting to the ZKTimeNet database (assuming it is a PostgreSQL database). If it is a different type of database (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle), the appropriate Python driver will be used.
- **Batch Processing**: A background task scheduler like `APScheduler` will be used to run the nightly synchronization job.

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

### Approach
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented to enforce the permissions defined in the feature specification.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used for authenticating users.

### Technology
- **Library**: A library like `FastAPI-Users` could be used to handle user registration, login, and password management. It is highly customizable and supports various database backends.
- **Custom Middleware**: A custom middleware will be written in FastAPI to inspect the JWT and determine the user's role. This middleware will then enforce the access control rules for each endpoint.

## 4. UI/UX Design

### Approach
- A modern, clean, and professional user interface will be built using a component library.
- The UI will be designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate.

### Technology
- **Component Library**: Material-UI (MUI) for React.
- **Rationale**: MUI provides a comprehensive set of pre-built components that follow Material Design guidelines. This will allow for rapid development of a high-quality user interface.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Bootstrap (also a good choice, but MUI offers a more modern look and feel), Tailwind CSS (a utility-first CSS framework that would require more design work from scratch).
