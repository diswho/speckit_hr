# Feature Specification: HR Management Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-design-and-build`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Design and build a web app for HR managers to handle recruiting, onboarding, and performance reviews. Key features: Dashboard: A personalized view for all users, including HR managers, department heads, employees, and job applicants. Recruiting: Manage job postings and track applicant pipelines. Onboarding: Create and assign onboarding tasks for new hires. Performance Reviews: Schedule reviews and allow employees to complete self-assessments. Reporting: Generate reports on recruiting and performance data. Notifications: Send automated reminders for key tasks and events. Integration: Must import data from ZKTimeNet. The app needs a clean, professional, and intuitive user interface with secure, role-based access."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An HR manager uses the web app to manage the entire employee lifecycle, from posting a new job opening to conducting performance reviews.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an HR manager is logged in, **When** they navigate to the recruiting section, **Then** they can create a new job posting.
2. **Given** a new employee is hired, **When** the HR manager accesses their profile, **Then** they can assign an onboarding plan.
3. **Given** an employee is due for a performance review, **When** they log in, **Then** they are prompted to complete their self-assessment.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when importing data from ZKTimeNet fails?
- How does the system handle an employee being a department head and a regular employee simultaneously in terms of permissions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a personalized dashboard for HR managers, department heads, employees, and job applicants.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow HR managers to create and manage job postings.
- **FR-003**: System MUST track job applicants through a pipeline.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow HR managers to create and assign onboarding tasks.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow HR managers to schedule performance reviews.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow employees to complete self-assessments for performance reviews.
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate reports on recruiting and performance data.
- **FR-008**: System MUST send automated email notifications for key tasks and events.
- **FR-009**: System MUST import data from ZKTimeNet via a direct, read-only database connection.
    - **Data to Import**:
        - Employee master data from `hr_employee`, `hr_department`, and `hr_position` tables to synchronize user profiles and organizational structure.
        - Employee attendance data from the `att_punches` table to log check-in/out events.
    - **Frequency**: The import will run as a nightly batch process.
- **FR-010**: System MUST have a clean, professional, and intuitive user interface.
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide secure, role-based access control with the following permissions:
    - **HR Manager**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access across all modules (Recruiting, Onboarding, Performance Reviews, Reporting).
    - **Department Head**: CRUD access for job postings and performance reviews limited to their own department. Read-access for employee profiles within their department.
    - **Employee**: Read-access to their own profile. Can complete assigned onboarding tasks and performance self-assessments.
    - **Applicant**: Read-access to public job postings and the status of their own applications.
